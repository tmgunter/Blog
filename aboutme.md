## My history

I grew up in Washington state in a city named Puyallup. As early as I can remember, I had an interest in computers and electronics and digital systems. I recall building my first computer when I was around the age of 14. After that the sky was the limit and I grew to have a real passion for computer systems and soonafter, coding (HTML, CSS, JS, PhP, Java, C#, and more). And after attending Pacific Lutheran University (PLU)--a private college located in Parkland, WA--to get my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I began my career into software engineering as a developer for Liberty Mutual Insurance, then contracting as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, and now a sofware engineer at Microsoft.

(1) Microsoft has been my favorite company to work for. I get to build awesome cloud services in Azure, build helpful tools and right outside my building there are walking trails with a nice canopy of trees over them. It's an excellent balance and the path makes it hard not to want to go on walks outside.

I also have a passion for the environment and science. A few years ago I became actively aware of how wasteful we are as humans. From food waste, to plastics, to the problems perpetuated by the industries selling products. After that, my girlfriend and I decided to start making small steps towards reducing our own waste. We started reading more about how we could be more sustainable in our daily lives, began composting, gardening, even switching to cloth napkins instead of using paper towels. I found that these are all simple things that everyone can accomplish and I have a passion for driving a more sustainable society.

I decided to start this blog to be able to communicate my thoughts on a mixture of topics ranging from programming to sutainability concepts and my experiences with composting and gardening.

I hope you find it interesting and that it sparks discussions. But most of all: thanks for visiting!
