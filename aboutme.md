## My history

I grew up in Washington state in a city named Puyallup, WA. As early as I can remember, I had an interest in computers and electronics and digital systems. I recall building my first computer when I was around the age of 14. After that the sky was the limit and I grew to have a real passion for computer systems and soonafter, coding. And after attending Pacific Lutheran University (PLU)--a private college located in Parkland, WA--to get my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I began my career into software engineering as a developer for Liberty Mutual Insurance, contracting as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, and now a sofware engineer at Microsoft.

Along with my drive for computers, so did my love for science and our environment. A few years ago I started becoming more aware to how much plastic and waste we as humans introduce and our impact on the planet. After that my girlfriend and I decided to start making small steps towards reducing our own waste, and we started reading more about how we could be more sustainable in our daily lives.

I decided to start this blog to be able to communicate my thoughts on a mixture of topics ranging from programming to sutainability concepts and my experiences with composting and gardening.

I hope you find it interesting and that it sparks discussions. But most of all: thanks for visiting!
